    <h3>Welcome to Disaster Buddies, connecting those in need of immediate need of help to volunteers in the area. </h3> 
    <p>
      Disaster Buddies was inspired by the true kindness of human nature. In times of natural disaster, communities often find themselves distraught and in need of help. Often times there is no local way to identify who needs assistance and who is safe and willing to help others. With Disaster Buddies, users who are struck by natural disasters can see out help from fellow community members who are in the position to help.
