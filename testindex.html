      No matter where we are in the world, natural disasters are a threat our communities face.

Recovering from the aftermath of it could be a lot to handle on your own, but luckily, Disaster Buddies are here to help you out or help you help out. This service connects those in need of aid after a disaster with those who want to lend a hand in just a few simple steps. And those good-hearted people who want to provide relief can easily find impacted areas to reach out to. The best thing you can ask for in a disaster is a buddy to help you out.
